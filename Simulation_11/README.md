# Simulation 11

For Simulation 11, the wave equation is:

$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}(z_1,z_2,t)-(i)^2\Big[\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}(z,t)\Big] = -u(z,t) + (u(z,t))^3$

$u(z,0) = \phi(z) = \sin(\pi z)$

$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(z,0) = \psi(z) = \sin(\pi z)$

We set $c=i$, $t=0.5$, $\lambda = 0.25$, and sample $z \in \big(\mathbb{R} \cap [0.00, 1.00] \big)$ on a 1-D grid of 101 points.
